# Design-and-Impelementation-my-own-CPU

The project is based on incremental development.

#At rtl4, a primary five-stage pipeline is realized and the first instruction ori is implemented.

#At rtl5, logical and shift instructions are realized, besides, the nop instruction is also realized.

#At rtl6, the move instructions are implemented.

#At rtl7, Arithmetric instruction and pipeline stall are realized.

#At rtl8, jump instruction and delay slot are realized.
