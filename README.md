# Design-and-Impelementation-my-own-CPU

The project is based on ncremental development model.

#At rtl4, a primary five-stage pipeline is realized and the first instruction ori is implemented.

#At rtl5, logical and shift instructions are realized, besides, the nop instruction is also realized.

#At rtl6, the move instructions are implemented.

#At rtl7, Arithmetric instruction and pipeline stall are realized.

#At rtl8, jump instruction and delay slot are realized.

#At rtl9, load and store instructions are realized.

Create Compiler Environment of the MIPS processor

Before designing this processor, I have planed it should be compatible with the architecture of MIPS32 instrustion set. Therefore, the existing GNU development tool chain under the MIPS32 architecture can be used.

1. Operation System
Ubuntu 16.04

2. Install GNU tool chain
